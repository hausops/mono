Monorepo for HausOps

## Local Dev Environment

We use [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) to manage service-to-service communication. To run multiple HausOps services locally and allow them to communicate with each other, you have to run them through Dapr.

### Gettings started

1. Install [dapr-cli](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/).
1. Install [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation). For example, on MacOS, you can install it with `brew install podman`.
1. Start Podman:

   ```sh
   podman machine init
   podman machine start
   ```

1. Run all services locally as configured in `hausops/mono/dapr.yaml` using [Dapr Multi-App Run](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/local-development/multi-app-dapr-run/multi-app-overview/):

   ```sh
   # cd hausops/mono
   dapr run -f .
   ```

1. To work on a service (temporary measure; let's figure out something better):

   - Comment it out from `dapr.yaml`.
   - Running the service using `dapr run`:

   ```sh
   # Example

   # cd apps/dashboard-api
   dapr run --app-id dashboard-api -- make run
   ```

   This way, you don't have to start/stop all services running via Multi-App Run when you need to start/stop the service under development.

### Clean up

To clean up your local environment:

```sh
# This command is the reverse of `dapr init --container-runtime podman`.
# It will remove Dapr containers from Podman as well.
dapr uninstall --container-runtime podman --all

podman machine stop
podman machine rm
```

### Architecture

The local dev environment for HausOps uses Dapr to manage service-to-service communication. Each service communicates with its own local Dapr sidecar, which handles service discovery, network resilience, observability, access lists, and other service-mesh functionality.

The services and their sidecars run as processes directly on the host machine, so they communicate over the host machine's network. Similarly, the Dapr sidecars communicate with the infrastructure components in containers from the host through Podman's published ports of the containers.

When a service runs, its Dapr sidecar binds to a randomized high port generated by Dapr. The port information is available through the `DAPR_GRPC_PORT` environment variable, which the service will use to communicate with other services. All HausOps service invocations are done through gRPC.

Each service should be started with the `--app-port` option. The app port can be any available port, as services communicate with each other through Dapr, so it doesn't actually use the app port.

To simplify management of the app's port, an environment variable `APP_PORT` is available to the service without the need to manually keep the app's port and the `--app-port` in sync. Note that if the `--app-port` option is not specified, `APP_PORT` will be undefined.
